Hello anyone! And welcome to a low quality minesweeper game project for CSC 1980.

As the title says, this project is essentially cats who don't want to be found but you're someone who wants to find where they are before they destroy your couch.
If you find them, unfortunately they're faster than you and you're going to be left with a stamp of missfortune.
However, if you manage to find all the cats are hiding, you win!

To run it, download the zipfile to your device. Unzip it and open it with visual studio code or your external editor!
Next, click on the main file and press run!

Optional, if you want to up the difficulty, click on the settings tab and scroll down until you see the name "AMMOUNTMINES". Then, replace the keyword 'pass' with the difficulty that you want to play in!

I did follow a minesweeper youtube tutorial! The link is; https://youtu.be/n0jZRlhLtt0?si=Gamk9npB7FyLtOQV
